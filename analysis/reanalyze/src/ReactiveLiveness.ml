     A position is externally referenced if any reference to it comes from
     a position that is NOT a declaration position (exact match).
     
     This matches the non-reactive algorithm which uses DeclarationStore.find_opt.
     
     We use join to explicitly track the dependency on decls. When a decl at
     position P arrives, any ref with posFrom=P will be reprocessed. *)
